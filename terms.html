            <h2>Section I:</h2>
            <p>
              By using this webpage, you agree to the terms that are listed on this page and the Privacy Policy that can be found on <a href="https://ban-appeals.glitch.me/core/policy/Privacy-Policy.md">https://ban-appeals.glitch.me/core/policy/Privacy-Policy.md</a>. You agree to be redirected to other webpages. Upon being redirected, the External Site's ToS and Privacy Policy Apply! We are not responsible for anything that occurs when or after you are redirected to another webpage.
            </p>
            <h2>Section II:</h2>
            <p>
              Please refrain from going to external sites and filling out false ban appeals. Users that are found to be purposefully spamming appeals, creating false appeals, creating troll appeals, etc. are subject to termination from appealing. We reserve the right to blacklist/terminate your ability to file an appeal through our discord, we are unable to fully prevent you from making an appeal.
            </p>
            <h2>Section III:</h2>
            <p>
              Users that violate the rules and/or requirements listed in the discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/VBuKUNzGUA">https://discord.gg/VBuKUNzGUA</a>) are subject to being banned from the discord server and/or Blacklisted from creating appeals. This Blacklist/Ban may be temporary or permanent. We have no way to prevent users from accessing appeals on the website as we do not store individual user data.
            </p>
            <h2>Section IV:</h2>
            <p>
              You are able to have your ban appeals for your discord server listed here as long as they follow the requirements set (listed via discord). By filing an application to have your appeals listed here, on the discord, or both, you agree to follow the rules set in the discord server. Violation of these rules/guidelines/requirements will result in termination. We will remove your appeals from both the discord and this website. For a limited time a message will appear stating you violated our rules and the appeals were removed. We reserve the right to remove your appeals for any and/or no reason! This site holds an option to report servers that may have violated our rules, terms, guidelines, and/or requirements. Creating a False Report will result in you no longer being able to file reports. Your appeal must be used for the right purposes. If we deem it is being used incorrectly, then we will enforce action and restrict it from our end. We are able to restrict, remove, disable, and edit your appeals for any and/or no reason. At any point, if we own the appeals we may want access to only the appeal channel. If we have access, you should not remove our access. Upon removing our access, you have a certain amount of time to give access back or we may terminate your appeals.
            </p>
            <h2>Section V:</h2>
            <p>
              Our License is provided on the homepage, and that license overwrites anything listed on the Terms of Service page if it contradicts what this page says.
            </p>
            <h2>Section VI:</h2>
            <p>
              We have a bot called "Ban Appeals#7070" that will help with your ban appeals. We require that you have this bot in your discord server to ensure users are able to appeal correctly. Exceptions can always be made, but this bot redirects banned users to us! More info can be found at <a href="https://ban-appeals.com/other">https://ban-appeals.com/other</a>. Users that do not use our bot must state the reason they do not want to use the bot. Your denial in using the bot may result in termination from our service. We reserve the right to terminate you from our appeals for any reason. We reserve the right to exempt you from SECTION VI of our ToS for any reason.
