                  To initiate the process of appealing a ban, we kindly request
                  that you visit the designated ban appeals page and carefully
                  select the server on which you wish to submit an appeal. Upon
                  completing this step, you will be directed to an external
                  platform where you will be required to fill out an appeal
                  form, providing relevant information pertaining to your case.

                <p>
                  It is a standard practice for our team to diligently process
                  ban appeals within a time frame of 24-48 hours. However, it is
                  important to note that the duration of this process may vary
                  depending on the volume of appeals we receive. We kindly
                  request that you exercise patience during this period and
                  refrain from submitting multiple appeals for the same ban as
                  doing so will only prolong the process and delay the
                  resolution of your appeal.

                  In the event that your ban appeal is denied, we respectfully
                  request that you refrain from submitting any further appeals.
                  Nevertheless, you may reach out to us to discuss the reason
                  for your ban and explore the possibility of any additional
                  actions that can be taken. Please be aware that we are unable
                  to reverse the decision.

                  Hey, sometimes we have to kick people out of our server, but
                  don't worry! Our bot, Ban Appeals#7070, will try to DM you to
                  let you know what happened and how to appeal the ban. Just so
                  you know, sometimes the DMs don't work because you need to be
                  in our Support Server and have your Direct Messages turned on.
                  If you are in the Support Server and DMs are on, please check
                  that the bot is online and working. But even if it's not, you
                  can still appeal your ban. If you need help or if the bot
                  isn't doing its job properly, you can always open a ticket on
                  our Support Server. We're here to help you out and get you
                  back in the game as soon as possible!
                </p>

                  Hello, if you are having trouble joining the support server
                  then you first need to check if are you banned from the
                  server? or is the invite invalid?
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you think you are banned from the server, try sending an
                  invite in a server you own or in a DM. Click join and if you
                  are banned a message will appear. If you see the ban message,
                  you have obviously been banned from our support server. We
                  mainly ban temporarly so wait a couple weeks and try again!
                  Most bans occur because of users abusing the ability to DM
                  other members in the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using our vanity invite: https://discord.gg/appeal might not
                  always work! This invite gets disabled if our support server
                  falls under 14 boosts. If you are trying to join via the
                  Vanity and its invaild, not working, or is showing another
                  server, we have extra options.
                </p>
                <p>
