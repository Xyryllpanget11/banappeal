            <p>
              In these Terms of Service, "DBA" refers to the Discord Ban Appeals
              program and/or the Discord Ban Appeals discord bot. "You" refers
              to the User. "Us and We" refers to the Discord Ban Appeal Team.
              "The bot" or "bot" refers to the Discord Ban Appeal Bot.
            </p>
            <p>
              By adding DBA to your server, interacting with DBA, and being in a
              server with DBA, you agree to these Terms of Service.
            </p>

            <h2>Section I:</h2>
            <p>
              The Discord Ban Appeals bot is not responsible for any damage or
              issues that may occur to your server in the event that the bot is
              used improperly. Therefore, you must use the bot only for its
              intended purposes.
            </p>
            <h2>Section II:</h2>
            <p>
              You must not use an excessive amount of commands in an attempt to
              overload or break the bot. If we observe any such behavior, we
              reserve the right to take appropriate action, including
              blacklisting your server, blacklisting you, or blacklisting any
              participants. We also monitor and log information for this reason,
              as explained in our Privacy Policy. Furthermore, you must not spam
              the bot's DMs, as this counts as a command. The bot is designed to
              listen for user commands only.
            </p>
            <h2>Section III:</h2>
            <p>
              If you violate these Terms of Service, we reserve the right to
              blacklist your server, blacklist you, blacklist involving
              participants, and/or blacklist anything. We may also remove the
              bot from your server and force it to leave when added when your
              server is blacklisted. If we blacklist a specific user, that user
              will be unable to interact with the bot.
            </p>
            <h2>Section IV:</h2>
            <p>
              You agree that we may log any non-personal data related to Discord
              in the servers where the bot is present, including the user who is
              using the bot. For more information about this, please refer to
              our Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h2>Section V:</h2>
            <p>
              DBA requires a set amount of permissions to work as intended.
              While you can edit these permissions, doing so may affect the
              bot's functionality. We require that the "/appeal" and "/about"
              commands are accessible to everyone. If we observe that these
              commands are inaccessible, we may kick the bot from your server,
              blacklist you, and/or terminate your ban appeals altogether.
              Please ensure that the Discord Integration Settings are set up
              correctly, and all slash commands with DBA must be @everyone
              accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exceptions can be made for servers that use verification, which
              are allowed to deny the @everyone role the ability to use
              "/appeal" and "/about". If you have denied @everyone permission to
              use those two commands, you must set up your verification role
              (aka member role) with the ability to use the commands.
            </p>
            <h2>Section VI:</h2>
            <p>
              This bot is not intended to cause harm to you, your members, or
              your discord server. You may customize the bot's permissions to
              your liking, with the exception of Section V. The bot will not
              engage in nuking, raiding, or any other intrusive, harmful, or
              malicious behavior. If you observe any suspicious or abnormal
              behavior, please contact us immediately and remove all permissions
              from the bot.
            </p>
            <h2>Section VII:</h2>
            <p>
              This bot has features that may be considered annoying by some
              members. By adding the bot to your server and/or being in a server
              that has DBA, you agree that the bot can perform the following
              actions: DM the members of your server, DM you, and reply to your
              DMs
            </p>
            <p>
              The bot will only DM you if you engage in specific actions, such
              as DMing the bot, getting banned from a server that has DBA, or
              getting unbanned from a server that has DBA. If you do not wish to
              receive DMs from our bot, please block it to prevent any further
              contact.
